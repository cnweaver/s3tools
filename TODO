Support multi-object delete
'Recursive' delete? (Using a prefix)
In s3ls, XML parsing should populate a data structure to be printed, rather than printing directly
	this would allow more formatting and sorting options
	output would not begin to appear until all results collected, however
		sometimes undesirable when listing large 'directories'
		might include a flag to return to an 'online' output system
Allow regions besides "us-east-1"
Figure out whether anything should be done to support 'virtual host style'
Support setting bucket permissions?
Support range GET requests

If an S3 feature is supported by neither Ceph nor Minio, implementing it in this code is not very interesting. 
Ceph features: http://docs.ceph.com/docs/hammer/radosgw/s3/#features-support
Minio features: https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/135a6a7bb4d80fb7eb2f23df331f652f1b1d8a33/docs/minio-limitations.md
